1.Create a View displaying the top 5 customers

CREATE VIEW TopCustomers AS
SELECT companyname,SUM(quantity * unitprice) as "Total Sales"
FROM customers,orders,orderdetails
WHERE customers.customerid = orders.customerid AND orders.orderid = orderdetails.orderid
GROUP BY companyname ORDER BY 2 DESC

ANOTHER WAY--CREATE VIEW TopCustomers AS
SELECT companyname,SUM(quantity * unitprice) as "Total Sales"
FROM customers C JOIN orders O ON C.customerid = O.customerid
JOIN orderdetails OD ON O.orderid = OD.orderid
GROUP BY companyname ORDER BY 2 DESC
